    <p>
      The leafy seadragon or <span class="latin">Glauert's seadragon</span>, is
      a marine fish. It is the only member of the genus Phycodurus in the family
      Syngnathidae, which includes seadragons,
      <span class="latin">pipefish</span>, and
      <span class="latin">seahorses</span>. It is found along the southern and
      western coasts of Australia.

    <h2>Descriptiona</h2>
    <p>
      Much like the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seahorse">seahorse</a>, the leafy
      seadragon's name is derived from its resemblance to another creature (in
      this case, the mythical
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon">dragon</a> ). While
      not large, they are slightly larger than most seahorses, growing to about
      20–24 cm (8–9.5 in). They feed on plankton and small
